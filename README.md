# Lyrics Search Assistant 

The **Lyrics Search Assistant** is a simple and fun Python project.
**Type a song name or artist, and get the lyrics instantly.**

To make this possible, I used the **`lyricgenius` Python module**, which allows the program to fetch lyrics directly from the Genius API.

## **🌟 What This Project Does**

* Lets you **search for lyrics** using a song name, keyword, or artist
* Fetches lyrics using the **`lyricgenius` module**
* Displays full lyrics in a clean, readable way
* Handles errors politely (like “lyrics not found”)
* Works completely in the **command line**

## **🧰 Technologies Used**

* **Python 3**
* **`lyricgenius` module** (for fetching lyrics)
* `requests` (dependency for API communication)

## **🚀 How to Run the Project**

1. Install Python 3.
2. Install the required modules:

```
pip install lyricgenius
pip install -r requirements.txt     # if you included one
```

3. Run the program:

```
python main.py
```

## **🔍 How It Works **

1. The program asks what song or artist you want.
2. It uses **`lyricgenius`** to connect to the Genius API and fetch the lyrics.
3. If the lyrics exist, they’re shown on screen.
4. If not, the program informs you and asks again.

The flow is simple and user-friendly.
